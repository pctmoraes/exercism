# Exercism Repository

## Overview
This repository contains my programming exercises from [Exercism](https://exercism.org/). Exercism is a platform that offers coding exercises to help improve coding skills in various programming languages

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders in which each folder represents a programming language.

I am currently studying Go and each exercise consists of a dedicated directory containing the Go files related to that exercise.
